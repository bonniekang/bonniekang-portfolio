                    <p>I started learning how to code early last year while working at a fashion tech startup which made me gain the experience working closely with developers and also interests in how companies grow rapidly with technology. After a few months of self taught journey, I decided to go to a coding bootcamp, Le wagon London to put all my time and energy into web development.</p>
                    <p>After the graduation, I immersed myself in filling the gap by educating myself with the most demanding programming skills such as React, Redux and Node JS and going through what I learnt from the bootcamp and coding challenges I couldn't solve at that time in order to solidify Ruby and JavaScript skills.</p>
                </div>
                <div className="content-2">
                    <p>Even if it has been a slow pace to get the job, I have been trying to do a ’1 commit a day’ through this year. Also, I participated in ‘Chingu voyage’ which is a digital collaboration matcher for tech-learners from all over the world and experienced the real agile development process for seven weeks.</p>
                    <p>My strong customer focused mindset possessed through various customer facing work experience from Retail, E-commerce and Exhibition industry will help me think from the user's perspective when building a product. I would like to combine it with technical skills for building excellent-level solutions and websites.</p>
